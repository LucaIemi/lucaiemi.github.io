{"name":"Luca Iemi","tagline":"luca.iemi@gmail.com","body":"\r\nI am a PhD student in cognitive neuroscience at the Berlin School of Mind and Brain and Charité Universitätsmedizin, working with Niko Busch and Felix Blankenburg. My research investigates how spontanoues brain activity influences perception. I use a combination of visual psychophysics, electroencephalography and computational modelling to understand the perceptual and neural effects of spontaneous alpha oscillations.\r\n\r\nYou can view and download my CV \r\n***\r\n[here].\r\n\r\n### Journal Articles\r\nIemi L, Chaumon M, Crouzet S, & Busch NA (in preparation) Weak alpha oscillations make you see more, not better.\r\n\r\n### Posters\r\nIemi L, Chaumon M, Crouzet S, & Busch NA (2015) Detection vs Recognition: uncovering the role of spontaneous alpha oscillations in visual processing.
